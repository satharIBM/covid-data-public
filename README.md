# COVID-19 Data Sources
Repository for regularly-updated data sets used by
[covid-data-model](https://github.com/covid-projections/covid-data-model). Anything that we want to re-fetch periodically should definitely live in this repo, along with scripts for automated updating.

## Notes
* Use README.md files to document where data has been sourced from.
* When committing updated data, include timestamp / version info to help
  describe the exact version of the data that's being imported. Consider 
  including it in a version.txt file as well as in your commit message.  To 
  the extent possible, we want clear audit trails for incoming data.
* Don't check in multiple versions of the same data. We can rely on git history
  instead.
* If data is being downloaded / scraped by a script, check the script in under
  scripts/
* Git LFS is required to correctly checkout at least the US Census Shapefiles
  for now because they are very big. You have to run something like `git lfs
  install` and `git lfs fetch`.

## Date sources for current / future use.
These are data sets that we've found that look interesting and we may want to consider pulling in the future.
